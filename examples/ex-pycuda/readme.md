# pyCUDA Hello World

Step 1. Load modules. *only necessary one time*

Step 2. Make file. *only necessary if changes were made to the Python code*

Step 3. Nothing. [no compiling necessary?!?]

Step 4. Check output. *.out file should contain a line printed by each core*

```
source setup.sh
sbatch sbatch.run
cat cuda_hello.out
```
